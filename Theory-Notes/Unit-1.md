**Types of agents and environments:**

In the context of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, **agents** and **environments** are two core concepts.

### **Types of Agents**

An **agent** is anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and act upon that environment through actuators.

#### 1\. **Simple Reflex Agents**

�         Act only based on the current percept (input).

�         Use condition-action rules (if-then).

�         **Example:** Thermostat that turns off the heater if the temperature is above a threshold.

#### 2\. **Model-Based Reflex Agents**

�         Maintain an internal model of the world.

�         Can handle partially observable environments.

�         **Example:** Robot vacuum that remembers the layout of a room.

#### 3\. **Goal-Based Agents**

�         Act to achieve a specific goal.

�         Use search and planning.

�         **Example:** GPS navigation system planning the best route to a destination.

#### 4\. **Utility-Based Agents**

�         Choose actions based on a utility function to maximize happiness/satisfaction.

�         Handle trade-offs between conflicting goals.

�         **Example:** Self-driving car choosing a route that is fast **and** safe.

#### 5\. **Learning Agents**

�         Can learn from experience.

�         Improve performance over time.

�         **Example:** AI playing chess or Go that gets better by playing more games.

### **Types of Environments**

An **environment** is everything the agent interacts with.

#### 1\. **Fully Observable vs. Partially Observable**

�         **Fully Observable:** Agent can access the complete state of the environment at all times.

o    _Example:_ Chess.

�         **Partially Observable:** Agent has incomplete or noisy information.

o    _Example:_ Poker or driving in fog.

#### 2\. **Deterministic vs. Stochastic**

�         **Deterministic:** Next state is completely determined by the current state and action.

o    _Example:_ Puzzle games like Sudoku.

�         **Stochastic:** Outcomes involve randomness.

o    _Example:_ Dice games.

#### 3\. **Episodic vs. Sequential**

�         **Episodic:** Agent�s experience is divided into independent episodes.

o    _Example:_ Image recognition tasks.

�         **Sequential:** Current decision affects future decisions.

o    _Example:_ Playing a video game.

#### 4\. **Static vs. Dynamic**

�         **Static:** Environment does not change while the agent is thinking.

o    _Example:_ Crossword puzzles.

�         **Dynamic:** Environment can change while the agent is thinking.

o    _Example:_ Real-time strategy games.

#### 5\. **Discrete vs. Continuous**

�         **Discrete:** Limited number of possible states and actions.

o    _Example:_ Board games.

�         **Continuous:** Infinite number of possible states and actions.

o    _Example:_ Robot arm movement.

#### 6\. **Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent**

�         **Single-Agent:** Only one agent acts in the environment.

o    _Example:_ Maze-solving robot.

�         **Multi-Agent:** Multiple agents interact, may cooperate or compete.

o    _Example:_ Multiplayer online games or stock trading systems.

**Agent Architecture in AI:**

An **agent architecture** is the structure or design that defines how an agent is built � how it **perceives**, **processes information**, **makes decisions**, and **acts**. It�s like the blueprint or internal structure of the agent.

### **Main Types of Agent Architectures**

#### 1\. **Simple Reflex Architecture**

�         **Description:** Acts only on the current percept, using **condition-action** rules.

�         **Structure:**

Percept → Rule → Action

�         **Pros:** Fast and easy to implement.

�         **Cons:** No memory or learning, poor in complex environments.

�         **Example:** Thermostat (If temperature > 25�C → Turn off heater)

#### 2\. **Model-Based Reflex Architecture**

### Problem-Solving Agents in AI

A **problem-solving agent** is a type of AI agent that uses **search algorithms** to find a solution to a problem by reasoning about the future. These agents are central to classical AI and operate in **deterministic**, **fully observable**, and **discrete** environments.

Key Concepts
------------

A problem-solving agent typically follows this process:

1.      **Formulate the problem** � Define initial state, goal state, and actions.

2.      **Search for a solution** � Explore the possible states using a search algorithm.

3.      **Execute the solution** � Carry out the sequence of actions.

Elements of a Problem
---------------------

A well-defined problem includes:

**Element**

**Description**

Initial State

The agent's starting point

Actions

All possible actions available at a given state

Transition Model

The result of an action (i.e., next state)

Goal Test

Determines whether a given state is a goal state

Path Cost

A function that assigns a cost to a sequence of actions

Example Problems and Approaches
-------------------------------

Here are some classic AI problem-solving examples and their approaches:

### 1\. **Route-Finding Problem (Map Navigation)**

**Problem:** Find the shortest path between cities (e.g., from Arad to Bucharest in Romania).

�         **State**: Current location

�         **Actions**: Drive to a neighboring city

�         **Goal Test**: Are you in Bucharest?

�         **Path Cost**: Distance driven (km or time)

**Approaches**:

�         **Uninformed Search**:

o    Breadth-First Search (BFS): Guarantees shortest path (if cost = step count)

o    Depth-First Search (DFS): Memory efficient, but not optimal

�         **Informed Search**:

o    A\* Search (with straight-line distance heuristic): Efficient and optimal

### 2\. **8-Puzzle Problem**

**Problem:** Move tiles on a 3x3 grid to reach the goal configuration.

�         **State**: Current tile configuration

�         **Actions**: Move blank space (up, down, left, right)

�         **Goal Test**: Does the current state match the goal configuration?

�         **Path Cost**: Number of moves

**Approaches**:

�         **A**\* with heuristics:

o    h1 = Number of misplaced tiles

o    h2 = Sum of Manhattan distances of tiles from goal

### 3\. **Robot Navigation in a Maze**

**Problem:** Move a robot from start to finish in a maze.

�         **State**: Current cell in the maze

�         **Actions**: Move in four directions (if no wall)

�         **Goal Test**: Is the robot at the goal location?

�         **Path Cost**: Number of steps or energy used

�**Approaches**:

�         BFS for simple shortest path

�         A\* if cost per move varies (e.g., terrain difficulty)

### 4\. **Missionaries and Cannibals Problem**

**Problem:** Transport missionaries and cannibals across a river without ever outnumbering missionaries.

�         **State**: Number of missionaries/cannibals on each side + boat location

�         **Actions**: Move valid combinations across river

�         **Goal Test**: All safely on the other side

�         **Constraints**: Missionaries ≥ Cannibals on both sides (or missionaries get eaten)

**Approach**:

�         Use BFS or DFS with pruning to avoid invalid or repeated states

### 5\. **Chess (Simplified or Full Game)**

**Problem:** Find the best move given a board configuration.

�         **State**: Current configuration of pieces

�         **Actions**: Legal chess moves

�         **Goal Test**: Checkmate or winning material advantage
